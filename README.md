# Invoice-OCR-Batch-Processing
This Python project automates the extraction of key data from invoice images using Tesseract OCR and OpenCV. It is designed to handle batch processing of multiple invoices stored in a folder, extracting essential fields like Invoice Number, Date, and Total Amount, validating completeness, and saving all results into a structured Excel file.
